# .PrettyOnionNameFinder
Find an readeable onion url for Tor network, with Azure cloud compute service and scallion

## Deprecated solution
CPU perf are very low, even the integraded GPU of a small laptop is 100x more powerfull than a cloud CPU
But, I let this project availeable because some aspect (cloud install drivers) may be usefull for others Azure projects.
